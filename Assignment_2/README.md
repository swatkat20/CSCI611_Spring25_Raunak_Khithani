Assignment 2 - CNN and Image Filtering

This repository contains two sections - image processing and CNN.

Folder Structure:
image_filtering/
    image_filtering.ipynb: Demonstrates image filtering techniques.
    Uses building2.jpg and golden_gate.jpg

build_cnn/
    build_cnn.ipynb: Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.

Requirements:
To work with this project, ensure you have the following:

1. Miniconda/Anaconda installed
2. VS Code with the Jupyter extension or Jupyter Notebook


Follow these steps to set up and run the notebooks:

1. Set Up the Conda Environment:
    Run the following commands in your terminal:
        conda env create -n ml -f environment.yml
        conda activate ml
    Launch Jupyter Notebook:
        Open the notebooks (image_filtering.ipynb and build_cnn.ipynb) in your preferred editor.
        If using VSCode, ensure the Jupyter extension is installed and select the ml kernel.

2. Run the Code:
    Execute the cells in the notebooks to explore the image filtering pipeline and CNN implementation.
